## What is Big Data?
- I would argue Big Data can be defined as anything that can be organized an    d interpreted, and there is motivation to accomplish such with contemporary tools and practices.

## Data Set that Interested me and Boggled my Brain (awesome-datasets)

- A really cool data set I found was the [maplight bill positions](https://www.maplight.org/data-series) in that awesome data sets repo. I found it cool because there's some useful potential analysis that can be done. Like imagine grouping by industry type and seeing which types of state bills are supported?

## Book I'm really interested in (free-data-science-books)

- A really cool read I seriously want to find time to dive into was [A Course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info/) by Hal Daum√© III because I don't know much about machine learning and always wanted to learn.
